With the winners of the Solana Hyperdrive Hackathon announced, I'd like to take the time to talk about my experiences, learnings, and actions moving forward after the conclusion of the competition. While we failed to place, or get an honorable mention, the silver lining is the feedback and learnings gained that motivate me to continue building the future of funding powered by blockchain.
## Experience
After a short hiatus from the project in August & September, I found myself playing catchup to finish a demo of Stockpile V2 by the deadline. Due to this, I opted to cut key features, and the product suffered because of it. Additionally, this took away from the quality of the pitch. As a whole, we struggled to cohesively communicate the value proposition of our different sections, and how they interact. This was a failure on my part.

While building, I progressed in a vacuum. There was little to no solicitation for feedback while the product was in development. This stemmed from shortcomings in my ability to ask the right questions regarding what potential users want. This is the core of figuring out the right thing to build, which is the hardest challenge of most startups.

As the deadline approached, I found myself scrambling at the last minute for this quality feedback. This led to an inability to incorporate all of the feedback received in time, and a detriment to the quality of our submission. This procrastination was ultimately one of the factors that cost us a placing or honorable mention.

## Takeaways
If I could sum up my takeaways in one sentence, it would be this:

*We need offerings that make both project owners, organizations and their contributors have that "wow" moment.*

At the core, I believe this was our shortcoming. To this point, both onlookers and I see our product as better sameness. An aggregated, marginal improvement on systems implemented elsewhere. This is not conducive to a competition and ecosystem that values things that are new and novel. We must think far outside the box to find new use-cases for the systems we have built, and will build for the future.

Another shortcoming that I learned from talking to judges was our previous existence. By this point, I've submitted Stockpile for LamportDAO Sandstorm, Solana Grizzlython, and Encode's Summer Hackathon. We managed to place in just one of these. Despite massive improvements to our core product, our name being known for months seemed to be a factor in our performance. Learning from this, it's important we don't embody the definition of insanity any longer. With this, it's imperative that we look to other methods of support. Our continued existence will likely be a detriment to our performance in future competitions, and we can't rely on grants indefinitely. We must seek other methods of support in the form of incubators, accelerators, and pre-seed funding.
## Moving Forward
We have a few key points to focus on as we close out the year, and move into 2024. This is a broad action plan that, while subject to change, will serve as a guide to what can be expected from Stockpile.
### â–º Soft-Pivot
While helping to fund Web3 projects will remain a core function of Stockpile, we must seek other ways to accomplish this. Our current system is not attractive or beneficial at scale in its current state. Each project, organization, and initiative has their own needs that need to be met, needs that won't fit into a one-size fits all method of funding. Here's are some ideas on what we plan to do about this:

##### ðŸª™ NFT & Token Launchpads
These are two products I've looked at for awhile. One of the original goals of Stockpile, then called Mobius Protocol, was to incorporate an NFT launchpad. However, after the failure of many token and NFT launchpads, it's clear we'd need a fresh take on both to gain the mindshare of the wider community. 

For this, we'd seek a strategic partner to develop the launchpads in conjunction with. Our first endeavor would be the NFT launchpad, as we currently have partners in mind for this.
##### ðŸ’¸ Quadratic Funding for Universities
A recent initiative of ours has been to utilize quadratic funding for university organizations. As a current student, I've seen firsthand possibilities of improvements to current systems using it. My plan is to conduct our first case-studies with Clemson Blockchain and Clemson Build, and use quadratic funding to distribute club funds to projects based on member votes. The next course of action would be to use a similar grant system to allocate funding to research initiatives in a singular department.

Once the first case-studies are conducted, I'll write a long-form paper on the findings. I am planning to have this finished by the end of the year.
#### ðŸ“ƒ Tokenized SAFEs
A major goal of mine is to successfully and compliantly tokenize equity agreements like SAFEs. These would be distributed when a qualified contribution to a crowdfund is made, and would ideally be tradeable OTC. From preliminary talks with lawyers, this requires modification to the original Y-Combinator agreement, notably in its assignment clause. Ultimately, this would be a great leap forward for funding startups on-chain. 

However, it will be by far our most difficult action item. With the current state of blockchain regulation in the US, we'd run a major risk of SEC action against us. A way to mitigate this would moving off-shore, and this is currently being explored.

### â–º Incubation & Fundraising
To continue sustaining the project, and achieve the goals mentioned in this article, we are raising a $500k pre-seed round. To help achieve this, we've applied to the Solana Labs Incubator. Throughout the last few weeks, I have not had much luck with web3-native VCs, and have opted to focus on working with local VCs and Angels in my area to help facilitate this round.

More on this later.
## Conclusion
Don't worry, we'll keep building, and keep getting better. While we didn't we get the result we were looking for, its important that we continue to push forward toward achieving the Stockpile mission. To me, nothing has changed. I'd like to thank everyone for the support they've given me thus far, and I will do everything in my power to not let all of you down.
