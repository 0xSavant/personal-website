With the winners of the Solana Hyperdrive Hackathon announced, I'd like to take the time to talk about my experiences, learnings, and actions moving forward after the conclusion of the competition. While we failed to place, or get an honorable mention, the silver lining is the feedback and learnings gained that motivate me to continue building the future of funding powered by blockchain.
