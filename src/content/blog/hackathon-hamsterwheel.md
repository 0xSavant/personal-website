Hackathons are some of the best events the tech industry has to offer. Where else can you meet new people, build awesome projects, and drink copious amounts of coffee while your mind crumbles into madness?

Jokes aside, hackathons are great. They give the budding developer an opportunity to connect with other developers, build something new, and maybe win a FitBit + some cash. They're a positive force in an industry where it feels like there aren't many of them. 

That being said, I've noticed something peculiar over the years. A phenomenon characterized by a shift in the culture of hackathons, and the behavior of those who compete in them. I call this the *"Hackathon Hamsterwheel"*.

### ► Hackathons as I knew them

My first experience at hackathon was my sophomore year of college. Every year the engineering department put on a 24 hour in-person competition, and it was a blast. I worked with two other people who I'd never met before, and we're all still friends to this day. We ended up taking home a prize, and it was one of the best feelings I had felt to date. I was hooked.

Throughout the next year, I'd find myself participating in hackathons every other month. These were generally online, since those are easier to come by. I'd get a team of random people from the event's discord, drum up an idea, and maybe get a finished submission out. This was the trough of disillusionment on full display. I tried desperately to build ideas that I was sure would be a winner, but coming up short time and time again. One would say, a skill issue.

During this period, I was still doing it for the love of the game. There weren't huge prize pools and a multitude of tracks. These were simple ordeals that were tailored for university students just getting started. This is stage one of the hamsterwheel.
