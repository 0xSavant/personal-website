				<code>
					I'm a full-stack developer and entrepreneur who enjoys working with AI/ML, embedded systems, and blockchains. I'm currently helping young professionals find the best jobs available with Positioner. I'm also the founder of Stockpile, a general purpose crowdfunding platform built on Solana.
					Previously, I worked in a marketing and operational role with SaveMAPS.io to provide assistance to small businesses during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Before that, I served as a general manager for Tech Equipment Sales, where I handled web administration, inventory and customer service for products like refurbished laptops and ECG machines.
					I started building products in 2013, by developing client mods and maps for Minecraft, DOOM, Quake, and Source engine games like Counter Strike, Gary's Mod, Half Life 2 & Team Fortress 2.
